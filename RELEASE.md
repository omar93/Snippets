## Assignment report

The assignment was to create an express CRUD application
that could store code snippets where you could read all
of the existing snippets but only update / delete your own with some authentication.


### Reflection

This assignment felt much harder than the previous ones we did
(it should be, new cource), but the thinking on this one was
different, we had only worked with clientside and that made
everything easier, now we worked on http request and responses
and alot more structure was added to this assignment.

Having said that, it felt really usefull and gave an insight to how things can be run and how much there is to do on the web.

I could have started earlier and put in more work during my start, I thought it was going to be as simple as the clientside js applications we did in the previous courses

### Further improvments

Wanted to try to implement the tag feature but also have some routing for your own snippets and to be able to tag other users

### Extras

No

### Feedback

It was fun, a bit hard but that's on me, good assignment
